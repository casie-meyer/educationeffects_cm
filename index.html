              <p class="card-text">With this first project, different data classification schemes were used to see how data could be classified 
                                  differently. There were six methods used to classify the African-American population for counties in the state
                                  of Nebraska. These included placing the data in a histogram, using a linear scale, a quantile classification, 
                                  a Jenks natural breaks classification, an equal interval classification, and a threshold classification. After 
                                  the data was classified, an image was created of the data's distribution along a number line to compare the
                                  distributions.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This project involved making a choropleth map. A choropleth map shows the variance in a variable over a region, with differences in color. The data used to 
                                    create the map was the population of people, aged 25+, in each state with a bachelor's degree. So as to not map the raw counts of the data, the 
                                    bachelor's-degree-holding population was normalized with the state's total population. The data was experimented with to determine the best way to
                                  display it. The data was displayed with shades of blue, and classified with a quantile scheme.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The third project in this portfolio was creating a proportional symbol map. A proportional symbol map shows the magnitudes of 
                                  a quantitative variable at different locations with proportionally sized symbols. The data used for this map was total enrollment
                                  at every college, university, or professional school in the United States. A point symbol map was created with the locations 
                                  of each higher education institution. These locations were placed on a regular map of the United States, so possible users
                                  can see where each institution is located. Then the enrollment trends the symbols were proportionally sized based on the number of students there are.
                                  This makes it possible to see trends in higher education enrollment across the US.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This project was a flow map created to learn about the flows of bananas in South America. A flow map is a map that shows
                                  the flows of anything (human/animal migrations, sale of commodities, etc.) over a basemap of where the movement is happening.
                                  Additionally, the markers on the map and the arrows that indicate flows are proportionally sized to the size of flow they
                                  represent. On this map, the flow of the South American banana trade are shown. The countries that receive/sell bananas are 
                                  indicated with a certain color. The flow of bananas between countries are represented by differently colored and proportionately
                                  sized arrows. The total flow of bananas received by a certain country are represented by proportionately sized circles.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In this project, a bivariate map was created. A bivariate map shows how two different variables change over
                                  a region in space. The variables used for this map were the percentage of bachelor's degree holders, and the 
                                  percentage of people living under the poverty line in each state. The change in the variables over the US is 
                                  shown in the legend with four different color schemes, for maximum accessibility for users. The legend shows 9 
                                  squares that represent if each variable (% of bachelor's degree holders and % of people living under the poverty 
                                  line) is classified as low, middle, or high. The states on the map's colors are assigned based on each variable's
                                  classification.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This project involved researching and learning about isarithmic maps. An isarithmic map is a map that represents
                                  continuous datasets. These datasets are connected by isolines, which connect areas of the same value. The map shown
                                  in the image represents the yearly total precipitation for the state of Iowa, and was made by University of Iowa 
                                  Professor Dr. Caglar Koylu. Click to learn more about isarithmic maps. </p>
