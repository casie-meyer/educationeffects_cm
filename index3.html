      </h1>
      
      <div class="row">
        <p> The next step of investigating these correlations is creating bivariate choropleth maps and comparing them. A bivariate choropleth map shows how 
            two variables can change over a space, instead of the single variable's change that normal choropleth maps show. This gives the opportunity to correlate
           the data more specifically, and look for more specific spatial trends. A bivariate choropleth map was made for each variable being investigated, each 
            again with the quantile classification scheme, so the maps can be compared. Every map will be available in four different color schemes for maximum 
            analysis of spatial patterns. The trends observed from each dataset will be used to complete the next portion of the study. Bivariate choropleth maps' trends
            classified with the low, middle, or high value of each variable. For example, on a bivariate choropleth map that shows a state with high educated population and 
            middle population under the poverty line, that state would be classified as "high-middle". Click on any project to be redirected to an ObservableHQ notebook

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This map was created to compare the bachelor's-degree-holding population with the population living under the poverty line. The bivariate choropleth map
                                  shows states with different levels of each population. There are a number of states in the deep South region of the US (Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana,
                                  Mississippi, Ababama, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia) that are classified as "low-high" (low educated population and high population under the poverty
                                  line). I think this is because some states in the deep South have some of the highest poverty rates in the US. Generally, education correlates with higher incomes,
                                  so if a state has a high population of those in poverty, it makes sense the educated population would also be low. Many states in the US's New England region 
                                  (New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Delaware) that are classified as "high-low". I think this is because of the 
                                  disproportionately high number of prestigious universities in this region (ex: the Ivy League Universities). These regions have the most defined trends, the 
                                  states in the rest of the US have many different classifications. These states with different classifications are scattered throughout the country. There 
                                  are a few clusters (Iowa/Nebraska/Kansas, and Georgia/Florida are "middle-middle) that represent the same trends, but most states aren't classified the same
                                  way as neighboring states (Idaho is "middle-low", Montana is "middle-high").</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This map was created to compare the bachelor's-degree-holding population with the population working in private industry. The bivariate choropleth map
                                  shows states with different levels of each population. This map shows trends somewhat similar to the previous map, because the trends of each state are scattered 
                                  throughout the US, with a few clusters (Michigan/Indiana/Ohio are "low-high", North Dakota/South Dakota/Wyoming are "low-low"). The trends are not always 
                                  region-specific. I think this is because the trends for the populations working in private industry follows the industry of each state more than the educated
                                  population. States with high populations working in private industry (Minnesota, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Florida), have a higher number of 
                                  private companies that people can work in. These states all have "...-high" classifications, because they have significant populations working in private
                                  industry. This trend follows for states that have less private companies (Montana, South Dakota, North Carolina, Louisiana). These states are some of the 
                                  least industrialized in the US, and have more opportunities to work in agriculture or nonprofit work. All of these states have "...-low" classifications
                                  because of the small populations working in private industry. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map shows a spatial correlation between the bachelor's-degree-holding population and each state's population of homeowners. This map is somewhat similar to the previous
                                  two, because there are more clusters of states that show similar trends, but many states still don't share trends with their neighboring states. There are some clusters of "low-middle" (
                                  Louisiana/Arkansas/Tennessee/Kentucky/Ohio), "low-high" (Mississippi/Georgia, North Dakota/Wyoming, Michigan/Indiana) and "high-high" (New Hampshire/Vermont). States with other classifications 
                                  are mostly scattered throughout the US with no pattern. I think this is because the factors that allow someone to be a homeowner extremely variable among states. The different variables 
                                  include income, the specific state's cost of living, race/ethnicity, amount of land in each state, or type of home owned. Each state in the US has a different population of ethnicities, a 
                                  different cost of living, and a different amount of land available for homes to be placed on. That leads to each state having different populations of homeowners. I think another reason there 
                                  isn't a clearly defined pattern throughout the US is because the choropleth map of each state's population of homeowners doesn't have a very clearly defined pattern. There are some areas of 
                                  very low/very high populations of homeowners, but other than these, many states have different populations than neighboring states. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of the state's population of homeowners, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of homeowners, and the light blue states represent low populations of homeowners. 
                                  When compared to the education map, no defined trend was found. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have more homeowners (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont),
                                  and vice versa (Nevada, Arkansas). This may be because the spatial trends for home ownership don't follow a specific, defined pattern. States with high and low homeowner
                                  populations are sprinkled around the US, with a few regions following patterns (ex: low homeownership on the west coast, high homeownership in most of New England).
                                  I think this is because of the drastic cost-of-living and median income differences in each state. States often have different economic statuses than neighboring states, 
                                  which could explain why the population of homeowners is so variable. Missouri has a higher median income than Arkansas, so more people may be able to afford to own a home there. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> This choropleth map of the state's population of people experiencing food scarcity, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of people experiencing food scarcity, and the light blue states represent low populations of people 
                                    experiencing food scarcity. When compared to the education map, a somewhat defined trend presented itself. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have lower populations 
                                    experiencing food scarcity (Massachusetts, Washington, Minnesota, Kentucky, Kansas, Virginia, Colorado), and vice versa (Kentucky, West Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, 
                                    New Mexico, Nevada, Arkansas). These trends are more region based than the spatial trends observed from the homeowning-population map, but are less defined than the population-
                                    under-poverty-line map. Despite this, the trend makes sense, because increased educational attainment generally leads to higher incomes, but some factor's are out of people's control.
                                    If you make enough money to afford food, but live in a rural area or a food desert, then your increased income won't necessarily prevent food scarcity. </p>

                                  of the neighboring states. These surprising spatial patterns were investigated by creating more maps. Some maps were created of the state of Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the only states that 
                                   represents "middle-middle" (ex: middle bachelor's degree population/middle population under poverty line) values for almost every bivariate choropleth map. Another state investigated is Florida,
                                  because Florida shows different trends for almost every bivariate choropleth map. Click this project (or navigate to the next page with the buttons below) for more maps investigating spatial
