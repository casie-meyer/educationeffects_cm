        <small>Additional Investigation of Spatial Patterns</small>
      </h1>
      
      <div class="row">
        <p> The final step of this project is investigating more specific spatial patterns in areas that show surprising spatial patterns. These surprising spatial patterns were investigated 
          by creating more maps. Some maps were created of the state of Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the only states that represents "middle-middle" (ex: middle bachelor's degree population/middle
          population under poverty line) values for almost every bivariate choropleth map. Another state investigated is Florida, because Florida shows different trends for almost 
          every bivariate choropleth map. These two states will be compared to the state of Minnesota, because the state of Minnesota represents trends that positively correlate with education for 
          every variable. Choropleth maps of Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota were created to investigate three trends at the county level of each state: percentage of bachelor's degree holders, 
          percentage of the population working in private industry, and the percentage of households receiving SNAP benefits. Click on any project to be redirected to

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text"> This section of the project involved making choropleth maps of education data in Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota. Each map was classified with the quantile classification 
                                    scheme for the sake of comparison. When looking at these maps, some interesting spatial patterns emerge. Florida's bins have a higher range (12.8%) than Nebraska's and 
                                    Minnesota's (7% and 6.1%, respectively) ranges. This could be because of the wide range of activities in Florida that are not availiable in other states. Florida is a much 
                                    more topologically/ecologically/geologically/economically diverse state than Minnesota and Nebraska, which could contribute to the high variance in the educated population. 
                                    Another spatial pattern visible is that in Minnesota, the most educated population is concentrated within 7 counties in the state's southeast region. This may be because of
                                    the presence of the University of Minnesota, which is a large state school. It could also be something else, because in Florida and Nebraska, the educated population isn't 
                                    centered around one large university.

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This section of the project involved making choropleth maps of private industry employee data in Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota. Each map was classified with the quantile 
                                  classification scheme for the sake of comparison. In Minnesota, the concentration of people working in private industry is in the same spot as the concentration of the highest 
                                  educated population. This trend doesn't hold true for Nebraska and Florida. This may be because in Nebraska, there is a significant amount of agricultur that takes place, 
                                  especially in the state's northwest region. The map shows the lowest number of private industry employees in the Northwest region, corresponding with the agriculture. In Florida,
                                  the concentrations of people working in private industry are in the state's central region and southeastern region. The southeastern region has a high educated population and a high
                                  population of private industry employees. Central Florida shows different trends. This may be because of the presence of DisneyWorld in central Florida, which is a massive private company
                                  that employs people, many of who's jobs don't require higher education.</p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text"> The final trend investigated in this project is the percentage of households in a state that receive SNAP benefits. SNAP stands for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and is 
                                    commonly known as food stamps. SNAP provides money for low-income families to purchase nutritious food. Choropleth maps were created to look at the spatial trends of SNAP benefits, 
                                    and each map was classified with the quantile classification scheme for the sake of comparison.In Minnesota, trends remain similar, with the lowest concentration of population 
                                    receiving SNAP benefits is the same concentrated region of a high educated population and a high population of those employed in private industry. I think this is because, as shown in 
                                    with previous choropleth/bivariate choropleth maps, increased educational attainment generally means increased income. This concentrated area might have higher income because of their 
                                    education, which would remove the need for SNAP benefits. In Nebraska, the same region that shows a low population of those working in private industry also shows high populations of those 
                                    receiving SNAP benefits. This may because agricultural jobs bring lower income, which would increase the need for receiving SNAP benefits. The state of Florida shows no spatial pattern for 
                                    households receiving SNAP benefits, with counties of high/low populations scattered around the state.

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text"> The maps in this section are proportional symbol maps that are meant to determine if the locations of higher education institutions influences the educated population of each state. A proportional
                                    symbol map shows the location of something with a symbol that's proportionate to one of its quantitative properties. The symbols in these maps represent the locations of higher education institutions, 
                                    and the size represents the number of people enrolled in the university. The symbols are placed over a basemap of each state, with symbols representing universities in neighboring states are left showing. 
                                    This is to show the higher education institutions in neighboring states, because many students go to college in neighboring states, so these may have an impact on a state's educated population. In Nebraska, 
                                    large universities don't correspond with high educated populations. This is because the counties with high and low populations of educated people are scattered throughout the state. The entire state of 
                                    Minnesota shows relatively high populations of educated people, and this doesn't correspond with institution locations. In Florida, the areas with high populations of educated people correspond pretty closely 
                                    to the locations of large universities.
