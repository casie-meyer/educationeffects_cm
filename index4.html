        <small>Additional Investigation of Spatial Patterns</small>
      </h1>
      
      <div class="row">
        <p> The final step of this project is investigating more specific spatial patterns in areas that show surprising spatial patterns. These surprising spatial patterns were investigated 
          by creating more maps. Some maps were created of the state of Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the only states that represents "middle-middle" (ex: middle bachelor's degree population/middle
          population under poverty line) values for almost every bivariate choropleth map. Another state investigated is Florida, because Florida shows different trends for almost 
          every bivariate choropleth map. These two states will be compared to the state of Minnesota, because the state of Minnesota represents trends that positively correlate with education for 
          every variable. Choropleth maps of Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota were created to investigate three trends at the county level of each state: percentage of bachelor's degree holders, 
          percentage of the population working in private industry, and the percentage of households receiving SNAP benefits. Click on any project to be redirected to

              <p class="card-text"> This section of the project involved making choropleth maps of education data in Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota. Each map was classified with the quantile classification 
                                    scheme for the sake of comparison. When looking at these maps, some interesting spatial patterns emerge. Florida's bins have a higher range (12.8%) than Nebraska's and 
                                    Minnesota's (7% and 6.1%, respectively) ranges. This could be because of the wide range of activities in Florida that are not availiable in other states. Florida is a much 
                                    more topologically/ecologically/geologically/economically diverse state than Minnesota and Nebraska, which could contribute to the high variance in the educated population. 
                                    Another spatial pattern visible is that in Minnesota, the most educated population is concentrated within 7 counties in the state's southeast region. This may be because of
                                    the presence of the University of Minnesota, which is a large state school. It could also be something else, because in Florida and Nebraska, the educated population isn't 
                                    centered around one large university.

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This section of the project involved making choropleth maps of private industry employee data in Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota. Each map was classified with the quantile 
                                  classification scheme for the sake of comparison. In Minnesota, the concentration of people working in private industry is in the same spot as the concentration of the highest 
                                  educated population. This trend doesn't hold true for Nebraska and Florida. This may be because in Nebraska, there is a significant amount of agricultur that takes place, 
                                  especially in the state's northwest region. The map shows the lowest number of private industry employees in the Northwest region, corresponding with the agriculture. In Florida,
                                  the concentrations of people working in private industry are in the state's central region and southeastern region. The southeastern region has a high educated population and a high
                                  population of private industry employees. Central Florida shows different trends. This may be because of the presence of DisneyWorld in central Florida, which is a massive private company
                                  that employs people, many of which don't require higher education.</p>

              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of the state's population of people working in private industry, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of private industry employees, and the light blue states represent low populations of private 
                                    industry employees. When compared to the education map, a somewhat defined trend presented itself. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have more private industry 
                                    employees (Massachusetts, North Carolina, Illinois, New Hampshire), and vice versa (Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, Idaho). This makes sense, because increased educational 
                                    attainment generally leads to those working a job that requires a college education, like many in the private industry. Despite this, the correlation between increased education and 
                                    private industry jobs is not as well defined as the correlation between education and lower levels of poverty. The most concentrated cluster of private industry jobs appears to be in
                                    the northern Midwest, which may be because of the recent increase in the technology and e-commerce industries in these states. </p>

              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of the state's population of homeowners, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of homeowners, and the light blue states represent low populations of homeowners. 
                                  When compared to the education map, no defined trend was found. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have more homeowners (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont),
                                  and vice versa (Nevada, Arkansas). This may be because the spatial trends for home ownership don't follow a specific, defined pattern. States with high and low homeowner
                                  populations are sprinkled around the US, with a few regions following patterns (ex: low homeownership on the west coast, high homeownership in most of New England).
                                  I think this is because of the drastic cost-of-living and median income differences in each state. States often have different economic statuses than neighboring states, 
                                  which could explain why the population of homeowners is so variable. Missouri has a higher median income than Arkansas, so more people may be able to afford to own a home there. </p>

                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of people experiencing food scarcity, and the light blue states represent low populations of people 
                                    experiencing food scarcity. When compared to the education map, a somewhat defined trend presented itself. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have lower populations 
                                    experiencing food scarcity (Massachusetts, Washington, Minnesota, Kentucky, Kansas, Virginia, Colorado), and vice versa (Kentucky, West Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, 
                                    New Mexico, Nevada, Arkansas). These trends are more region based than the spatial trends observed from the homeowning-population map, but are less defined than the population-
                                    under-poverty-line map. Despite this, the trend makes sense, because increased educational attainment generally leads to higher incomes, but some factor's are out of people's control.
                                    If you make enough money to afford food, but live in a rural area or a food desert, then your increased income won't necessarily prevent food scarcity. </p>
