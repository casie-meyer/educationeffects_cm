        <small>Additional Investigation of Spatial Patterns</small>
      </h1>
      
      <div class="row">
        <p> The final step of this project is investigating more specific spatial patterns in areas that show surprising spatial patterns. These surprising spatial patterns were investigated 
          by creating more maps. Some maps were created of the state of Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the only states that represents "middle-middle" (ex: middle bachelor's degree population/middle
          population under poverty line) values for almost every bivariate choropleth map. Another state investigated is Florida, because Florida shows different trends for almost 
          every bivariate choropleth map. These two states will be compared to the state of Minnesota, because the state of Minnesota represents trends that positively correlate with education for 
          every variable. Choropleth maps of Nebraska, Florida, and Minnesota were created to investigate three trends at the county level of each state: percentage of bachelor's degree holders, 
          percentage of the population working in private industry, and the percentage of households receiving SNAP benefits. Click on any project to be redirected to

                map was created to use as a comparison for other variables in this study. A choropleth map was created, using a quantile classification 
                                  scheme, to show the percentage of populations holding bachelor's degrees or higher in each state. The dark blue states on the map represent high 
                                  educated populations, and the light blue states represent low educated populations. There are a few spatial patterns to glean from this initial 
                                  map. States with high educated populations are clustered in New England, possibly because of the increased number of prestigious universities 
                                  in those states. One other notable region where many states with high educated populations are clustered is the US's west coast. This may be because of 
                                  the increased number of technical companies in that region that employ people who need a college degree. Besides the coasts,
                                  there are states with high (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota) and low (Wyoming, Nevada, Indiana) educated populations scattered around the middle of the US. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of the state's population living below the poverty line (annual household income of $24,999 or less), was created with a quantile classification
                                  scheme to compare to the educated population choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations living under the poverty line, and the light 
                                  blue states represent low populations living under the poverty line. When compared to the education map, a clear trend presented itself. In general, states with higher
                                  educated populations have lower populations living under the poverty line (Colorado, New Hampshire, Maryland, Delaware, Washington, Minnesota, Utah), and vice versa (
                                  Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, West Virginia). When looking at the maps side-by-side, the colors of the maps are mostly inverted. 
                                  This makes sense, because increased educational attainment is generally correlated with higher incomes. If more of a state's population is educated, more of the population 
                                  should have higher annual incomes, which would lead to lower populations living under the poverty line. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of the state's population of people working in private industry, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of private industry employees, and the light blue states represent low populations of private 
                                    industry employees. When compared to the education map, a somewhat defined trend presented itself. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have more private industry 
                                    employees (Massachusetts, North Carolina, Illinois, New Hampshire), and vice versa (Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, Idaho). This makes sense, because increased educational 
                                    attainment generally leads to those working a job that requires a college education, like many in the private industry. Despite this, the correlation between increased education and 
                                    private industry jobs is not as well defined as the correlation between education and lower levels of poverty. The most concentrated cluster of private industry jobs appears to be in
                                    the northern Midwest, which may be because of the recent increase in the technology and e-commerce industries in these states. </p>

              </h4>
              <p class="card-text">This choropleth map of the state's population of homeowners, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of homeowners, and the light blue states represent low populations of homeowners. 
                                  When compared to the education map, no defined trend was found. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have more homeowners (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont),
                                  and vice versa (Nevada, Arkansas). This may be because the spatial trends for home ownership don't follow a specific, defined pattern. States with high and low homeowner
                                  populations are sprinkled around the US, with a few regions following patterns (ex: low homeownership on the west coast, high homeownership in most of New England).
                                  I think this is because of the drastic cost-of-living and median income differences in each state. States often have different economic statuses than neighboring states, 
                                  which could explain why the population of homeowners is so variable. Missouri has a higher median income than Arkansas, so more people may be able to afford to own a home there. </p>

              <p class="card-text"> This choropleth map of the state's population of people experiencing food scarcity, was created with a quantile classification scheme to compare to the educated population 
                                    choropleth map. On the map, the dark blue states represent high populations of people experiencing food scarcity, and the light blue states represent low populations of people 
                                    experiencing food scarcity. When compared to the education map, a somewhat defined trend presented itself. Sometimes, states with higher educated populations have lower populations 
                                    experiencing food scarcity (Massachusetts, Washington, Minnesota, Kentucky, Kansas, Virginia, Colorado), and vice versa (Kentucky, West Virginia, Louisiana, Alabama, Wyoming, 
                                    New Mexico, Nevada, Arkansas). These trends are more region based than the spatial trends observed from the homeowning-population map, but are less defined than the population-
                                    under-poverty-line map. Despite this, the trend makes sense, because increased educational attainment generally leads to higher incomes, but some factor's are out of people's control.
                                    If you make enough money to afford food, but live in a rural area or a food desert, then your increased income won't necessarily prevent food scarcity. </p>

                                  of the neighboring states. These surprising spatial patterns were investigated by creating more maps. Some maps were created of the state of Nebraska. Nebraska is one of the only states that 
                                   represents "middle-middle" (ex: middle bachelor's degree population/middle population under poverty line) values for almost every bivariate choropleth map. Another state investigated is Florida,
